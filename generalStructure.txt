MAKControl - Responsible for Mouse And Keyboard control (concrete implementation is OS unique)
MAKControlWindows - MAKControl implementation for windows
VKKeysLookup - Basically a lookup table for keys used by the windows implementation

Snapshot - Responsible for taking screenshots and saving them to the correct folders, with the correct names...

UILearner - Responsible for recognising objects and their locations on screen. How should this work? You send in an
object and it returns its locations or you detect things and it returns all the things it has detected and their
locations? How to differentiate between objects? "Dictionary" with constants, basically an enum. Should it also return
size? Bounding box? Top left, bottom right?
Might need a good way to combine "known" locations and detecting objects which may move...

DetectImageLocationsInsideImage - This will take a small image and a larger image and return all the locations
where the small image occurs inside the large image... Maybe I already have a program that does this somewhere?
Convert images to numpy arrays and then do the (image1 == image2).all(1) (.any). This is now implemented and named
ObjectInImageDetector....
